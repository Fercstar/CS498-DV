        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
            The data used in the visualizations was taken from the Crime Data dataset at 
            <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Data/4fs7-3vj5">
            data.seattle.gov</a>. It was filtered to show only data from 2008 - 2017 and 
            pre-aggregated using Tableau Prep.
        </p>

        <h3>Visualization Structure</h3>
        <p>I used the martini glass hybrid structure. By scrolling through 
            several pre-defined views, the user learns how to use the visualization 
            works and is presented with some sample conclusions to help them analyze the 
            view further.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenes</h3>
        <p>
            There are six scenes in the visualization. Most of the scenes show the user
            how the visualization works. In the last scene, the user can select a category of 
            crime or an hour in the day to see either the crimes committed in that hour or the 
            times when particular categories of crime are committed.
        </p>
        <h3>Annotations</h3>
        <p>
            There are a few annotations throughout the visualization. The first one alerts 
            the viewer to the spikes in the histogram at 0 and 12 that are likely caused 
            by the time of occurance being estimated. The second and third annotations 
            point show how different crimes are more likely to occur at different times 
            of the day. Throughout the visualization the view can hover their mouse over 
            the bars to get additional details on demand in the form of a tooltip.
        </p>
        <h3>Parameters</h3>
        <p>
            There are several parameters the user can interact with to control the state of the 
            visualization. In the beginning slides, the only thing the user can do is move the 
            visualization backward and forwards by using the arrows to the right and left of the 
            charts. They can also view tooltips at all times.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On the last scene, the user can change the parameters of the visualization by clicking 
            on any of the bars in the Hour Crime Occurred and Category of Crime bar charts.
        </p>
        <h3>Triggers</h3>
        <p>
            The parameters in the visualzations drive several triggers. When a user moves forward 
            or backward through the scenes of the visualization, the progress bar moves with the user 
            to show them where they are at. Additionaly, there are triggers to change bar colors 
            based on user selections and scene changes.
        </p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            The visualization is best viewed on a computer and not a mobile device.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Choices</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the visualization, I went with a minimalistic style. I deliberately 
            did not include legends on the chart, because I wanted the viewer to be thinking 
            about relative frequencies and not absolute frequencies (e.g. how DUIs are 
            distributed throughout the day). The total number of crimes a bar represents 
            can be viewed on demand through the tooltip.
